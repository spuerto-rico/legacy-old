# Legacy Network (React Native)

A rewrite of the legacy Ionic app.

## Getting Started with Modern JavaScript

Modern JS allows to do more with less. This isn't your grandfather's JavaScript; get started
cacthing up.

Write components as functions; manage lifecycle plus local and shared state with hooks.

### Getting Started with React's Context API

This project makes use of React's Context API coupled with Hooks to manage global state.
Take some time to learn the the basics.

## Coding Style

### A Few Words on Coding Style


#### Line Breaks Are Your Friend

Don't be afraid to put line breaks â€” allow your code to breathe, for Chist's sake. It's very exhausting to read huge chunks of code when it's a huge chunk of text. Writing a condition after variable declarations? Line break. Reached the function's return statement? Line break.

Group blocks of code that do related things; line breaks are your friend.

### Code Commits


### Closing Open Issues

Issue tracking on this repo has been set up. Open issues can be closed in `git cz` by defining the commit as
affecting open issues and speificiying which issue numbers are affected. Do not close open issues
manually. Only do so when needed like instances where you forget to resolve the issues in your commit.
[Learn more](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/resolve-issues-automatically-when-users-push-code-221451126.html).


## Seting up Your Environment

### Node Environment

Install these globally on your machine.

#### Expo

```
npm i -g expo-cli
```


### Setting up your Editor

The guide below is for VS Code and Sublime Text users, but feel free to use any editor
you're comfortable with. I say, however, that the extra productivity the aforementioned
editors give you is too hard to pass up â€” even if VS Code eats up a ton of RAM.

## Running the App

Runinng the app locally is relatively easy. Just know that you need to have the right
SDKs to build for your target platform.

Install the project's npm packages first:

```
npm i
```

Then:

```
npm start
```
