                      Although we invite you to use email to introduce this opportunity to your personal contacts, there are anti-spam laws that must be followed in order to discourage governmental legal action. The definition of spam is the use of electronic messaging (email) to send unsolicited bulk messages indiscriminately. In short, you need to know who you are sending these emails to, and they should be expecting an email from you.{'\n'}{'\n'}
                      Please read our email spam rules and regulations very carefully and visit the { this.linkURL() } page where you will be taken to a short seven point synopsis of the law that clarifies your responsibilities as an advertiser. Legacy Network Team Members that fail to do comply with these email rules and regulations before marketing through email risk having their membership revoked.{'\n'}{'\n'}

                  All emails sent that advertise or link to the (1) LegacyNetwork.com site or (2) your personalized LegacyNetwork.com site are required to stay within these rules:{'\n'}{'\n'}

                  1. You are required to follow all rules in the CAN-SPAM ACT.{'\n'}
                  2. Your message must include your valid physical postal address.{'\n'}
                  3. No purchased lists. All people you send to MUST HAVE CONTACTED YOU DIRECTLY and asked for the information you are sending.{'\n'}
                  4. The list must be double opt in. This means that the customer must request to be added, and then you must send an email asking them to confirm the request.{'\n'}
                  5. You must include a clear and conspicuous opt out method and honor opt-outs promptly.{'\n'}
                  6. Include your first and last name prominently in the email.{'\n'}
                  8. Identify the message as an add. The law gives you a lot of leeway in how to do this, but you must disclose clearly and conspicuously that your message is an advertisement.{'\n'}{'\n'}

                  Please remember to monitor what others are doing on your behalf - those you may hire to assist you and your downline who may also be advertising. The law makes it clear that even if you hire another company to handle your email marketing, you cannot contract away your legal responsibility to comply with the law.{'\n'}{'\n'}
                  Both LegacyNetwork.com and the distributor who is promoting the product by sending the email message may be held legally and financially responsible.
