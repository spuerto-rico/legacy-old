                  Hosting a Team Member Certification Meeting shows that your business is growing! This means you have a new member 
                  who is ready to start building their business and needs to become certified so that their business tools can be 
                  activated. Well done! {'\n \n'}

                  As you learned from your Entrepreneurship Training, as soon as your new Team Member has completed their Entrepreneurship 
                  Training and practiced the skills they’ve learned, it will be time for you to lead their Certification Training Meeting. 
                  As their Sponsor, you play a central role in helping your new member complete this special certification process. {'\n \n'}

                  Remember, you are your new member’s life-line, along with the other Support Team Members who are participating with you. 
                  Your most important job (as well as the entire Support Team’s job) is to put your new member at ease. It is up to you to 
                  make sure your new member feels welcome, a part of the team and feels safe as they demonstrate the skills they have practiced. 
                  The better YOU are at making your Team Member feel confident, safe, and important, the better they will be at performing the 
                  skills they have worked so hard at perfecting. Setting this tone and providing this kind of environment during the meeting is 
                  your responsibility, so be the best sponsor you can be! {'\n'}

                      1. Reach out to your new member to congratulate them on completing their Entrepreneurship Training and preparing to be certified. 
                         Be sure they have completed all the items to be reviewed in the Certification Meeting (see agenda below). Encourage them to 
                         review the Certification Meeting Outline on Page 49 of their Entrepreneurship Training Workbook as part of their final 
                         preparation. {'\n \n'}

                      2. Schedule the online video meeting in Zoom or another service of your choice and send a calendar appointment to your team member. 
                         Be sure to include the connection information in your calendar invite. {'\n \n'}

                      3. Think through who on your team or in your up-line network of leaders would lend great support and insight to your team member’s 
                         certification experience and include them in your calendar appointment as well. If you feel strongly about someone joining the 
                         Certification Meeting as part of the Support Team, you may even want to give them a call and extend a personal invitation and 
                         let them know what a difference it would make if they would join. {'\n \n'}

                      4. On the day of the Certification Meeting, send a reminder text to everyone who will participate in the meeting. Review the agenda 
                         before the call so it is fresh in you mind. Initiate the web video meeting 10 minutes before the start time so you are first in the 
                         meeting room and can warmly welcome and chat with team members as they come on. {'\n \n'}

                      5. Enjoy the meeting and do your best to make it a great experience for all. {'\n \n'}

                  Now it is time to have your new member share the Top 5 Names on both their Potential Customer List and their Potential 
                  Team Member List (10 names total). Have them also share what it is about them that led your new member to choose them. {'\n'}

                <Text style={{fontSize: 16}}>
                  Next, invite your new member to engage in a role play to illustrate the conversation they will have with one name on 
                  each of their Potential Customer and Potential Team Member Lists. Your new member may choose who they would like to 
                  play the role of the potential customer and the potential team member in the role plays. Have them be sure to use the 
                  questions, listen, and use the storyline if each website for their conversations. If your new member feels some initial 
                  jitters, don’t worry, that’s natural. Assure them that they are safe and in good hands and that you, too, felt awkward 
                  at this stage when you were getting certified. Let them know you and all the Support Team members are happy to be there 
                  to cheer them on. Invite your new member to repeat this process until they feel comfortable and relaxed. This will be 
                  such a great moment for them. Help them take a deep breath and encourage them to just be themselves. Ask the Support Team 
                  for feedback and helpful hints as they try again. {'\n \n'}

                  Repeat this process to confirm your new member knows the features and content of both websites and their Dashboard and feels comfortable using the information to answer questions. {'\n'}

                <Text style={{fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Call to Action</Text>
                <Text style={{fontSize: 16}}>
                  Help your new member select two contacts from their lists that they want to engage with first. Recommend that they 
                  start with the 3rd and 4th names on their lists, as this lets them polish their invitation with these individuals 
                  and saves their best invitation for the 1st and 2nd people! Remind your new member that their goal is to enroll two 
                  customers and two members in the next two weeks, so they should get started quickly! Also, if they don’t get the 
                  response they desire, encourage them to reach out to you immediately so you can help role-play and refine their 
                  skills so they can try again. It is your responsibility to take these steps with your new member. Let them know you 
                  are standing by in case they need assistance. This is where the rubber meets the road—it is up to you to support 
                  and help your people succeed. {'\n'}

                  Congratulate your new member for their great work. This is a big deal and let them know you recognize it! Reaffirm
